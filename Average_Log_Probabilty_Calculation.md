Breaking down the "Average Log Probability" (avg_logprob) used in our code and why it typically has negative values (or zero).

1. Probability in Speech Recognition:

    At its core, a speech recognition model like Whisper is trying to find the most probable sequence of words given the input audio.

    For a given piece of audio, there are countless possible text transcriptions. The model assigns a probability score to many of these possibilities.

    For example, given audio of someone saying "hello world", the model might internally calculate:

        P("hello world" | audio) = 0.00001 (a small probability)

        P("yellow world" | audio) = 0.0000001 (an even smaller probability)

        P("hello word" | audio) = 0.000005 (maybe slightly more probable than "hello world" depending on the audio/model)

    The model outputs the sequence with the highest probability.

2. The Problem with Multiplying Small Probabilities:

    The probability of an entire sentence or phrase is often estimated by combining the probabilities of individual words or sub-word units (tokens) in sequence (e.g., P(word2 | word1) * P(word1)).

    These individual probabilities are almost always less than 1.

    When you multiply many small numbers (probabilities < 1) together, the result becomes extremely tiny very quickly.

    Computers have limitations in representing very small floating-point numbers accurately. This can lead to numerical underflow, where the result is so small it gets rounded down to zero, losing all information about relative likelihoods.

3. The Solution: Logarithms!

    To avoid multiplying tiny numbers, we switch to using logarithms. The key mathematical property is:
    log(a * b) = log(a) + log(b)

    Instead of calculating the product of probabilities, the model calculates the sum of the log-probabilities.

    Calculating log(P("hello world" | audio)) is much more numerically stable than calculating P("hello world" | audio), especially for longer sequences. Summing numbers (even negative ones) doesn't lead to underflow nearly as easily as multiplying very small fractions.

4. Why Log-Probabilities are Negative (or Zero):

    Probabilities (P) are always between 0 and 1 (inclusive).

    The logarithm function has the following properties (using natural logarithm ln or any base > 1):

        log(1) = 0 (This happens only if the model is 100% certain, which is extremely rare for real-world predictions).

        log(x) where 0 < x < 1 is always negative.

        As x gets closer to 0, log(x) becomes a larger negative number (approaches negative infinity).

    Since the probabilities assigned by the model to words/sequences are virtually always less than 1, their logarithms are negative.

5. What "Average Log Probability" Means:

    A transcription is made up of multiple tokens (words or sub-words). The model calculates log-probabilities related to predicting these tokens.

    avg_logprob provided by Whisper/Faster Whisper represents the average of these log-probabilities across all the tokens within a specific recognized segment (a continuous piece of speech identified by the model).

    Averaging helps normalize the score regardless of the length of the segment. A longer segment would naturally have a much larger negative sum of log-probabilities just because it has more tokens. Averaging gives a per-token sense of confidence.

    In your specific code: You further average these segment-level avg_logprob values if an utterance contains multiple segments, giving one overall transcription_avg_logprob for the entire detected speech block.

Interpretation:

    Closer to 0 (Less Negative): Indicates higher confidence from the model. The sequence of tokens predicted was considered relatively more probable by the model compared to alternatives.

    More Negative (Further from 0): Indicates lower confidence. The model found the predicted sequence less probable. This could be due to various factors like background noise, unclear speech, unusual vocabulary, accents the model isn't familiar with, etc.

So, the avg_logprob is a crucial indicator derived directly from the model's internal probability calculations, presented in a numerically stable (logarithmic) format where negative values are the norm, and values closer to zero signify greater confidence.
